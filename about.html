        <h2>About SecDevOps Digest</h2>
        <p>This blog is a personal project dedicated to exploring the fascinating and critical intersection of **security** and **DevOps**. In a world where software is developed and deployed at lightning speed, integrating security as a continuous, automated part of the process is no longer optionalâ€”it's essential.</p>
        <p>Here, I share my insights, document my experiments, and discuss best practices for building secure, automated, and resilient systems. From implementing static code analysis in a CI pipeline to securing cloud infrastructure as code, the goal is to bridge the gap between development efficiency and robust security.</p>
        <p>The site itself is a testament to the very principles I discuss: it's a simple, static blog built with Markdown, GitHub, and an automated CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Pages.</p>
        <h3>My Mission</h3>
        <p>To provide practical, actionable advice and to foster a community of developers and security professionals who are passionate about building secure software.</p>
